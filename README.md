# Bangladesh Climate Forecast

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical climate data from Bangladesh (1990-2023) and forecasts future climate trends up to 2025. Using comprehensive environmental data from various districts, the analysis explores patterns in temperature, rainfall, air quality, and other critical environmental factors to understand climate change impacts across Bangladesh.

## Key Features
- **Historical Climate Analysis**: Examination of climate trends across different regions of Bangladesh over the past three decades
- **Environmental Impact Assessment**: Analysis of relationships between climate variables and environmental metrics
- **Predictive Modeling**: Forecasting of future climate conditions using time series analysis and machine learning
- **Geospatial Insights**: District-level analysis showing regional variations in climate patterns
- **Data Visualization**: Comprehensive visualizations to illustrate climate trends and relationships

## Dataset
The dataset (`Bangladesh_Environmental_Climate_Change_Impact.csv`) includes the following variables for districts across Bangladesh:
- Year (1990-2025)
- District names
- Average Temperature (Â°C)
- Annual Rainfall (mm)
- Air Quality Index (AQI)
- Forest Cover Percentage
- River Water Level (m)
- Cyclone Count
- Flood Impact Score
- Drought Severity
- Agricultural Yield (ton per hectare)
- Coastal Erosion (m per year)
- Urbanization Rate Percentage
- Carbon Emission (Metric Tons per Capita)
- Renewable Energy Usage Percentage

## Technical Implementation
The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter notebook using Python with libraries including:
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for predictive modeling
- Statsmodels for time series analysis
- Folium for geospatial visualization (if applicable)

## Key Findings
- Identification of temperature and rainfall trends across different regions
- Analysis of correlations between climate factors and environmental impacts
- Prediction of future climate scenarios for different districts
- Assessment of climate change vulnerability by region

## Applications
This analysis provides valuable insights for:
- Environmental policy development
- Agricultural planning and food security initiatives
- Disaster management and preparedness
- Urban planning considering climate change impacts
- Conservation efforts and sustainable development planning

## Installation and Usage
